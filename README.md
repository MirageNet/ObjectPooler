* [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) principle. Everything needs to be **as simple as possible**. 
* An API is like a joke,  if you have to explain it is not a good one.  Do not require people to read the documentation if you can avoid it.
* Follow [C# code conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions).

* Keep your pull requests small and obvious,  if a PR can be split into several small ones, do so.
